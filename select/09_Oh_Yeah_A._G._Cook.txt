Oh yeah, I don't need you
No, yeah, you don't need me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, look me in the eye
Yeah, I never cry

Oh yeah, say I knew you
Oh yeah, like you knew me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let me read your mind
For the final time

I know what you're feeling (I feel it, too)
I know that you're falling (Falling away)
I know what you're thinking (Say the word)
I know that it's over (Over)

Oh yeah, never felt so
Oh yeah (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah), so alive
So let me tell you how to do it right
You only got one life

Oh yeah, you don't need it
No, yeah, just believe it
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we can make amends
Right before it ends

I know what you're feeling (I feel it, too)
I know that you're falling (Falling away)
I know what you're thinking (Say the word)
I know that it's over (Over)

Never say never, never say never again
Never say never, never say never again
Never say never 'cause I will always be a fan
